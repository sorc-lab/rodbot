### API Endpoints
    - XP PATH: Bot this path. Path should be only arg? If we wanted multiple guild support, Bot This path AS <guild>
        NOTE: This will be called via delegation. Don't want to give it a path at the API layer.
            e.g. ptol, gtop, ltobs, etc... These should be called via Mudlet aliases. in-game? What's the diff?
    - Traverse: Travel to this location. Hard coded paths. Don't want to pass in the path.
    - <Placeholder endpoints for all the Tek Bot triggers. Too many to list right now.>
    - Quaffer -> This works off of trigger
    - Need a help func that echos to screen all the API commands that can be called, not ones that are triggered.
    - AFK triggers: so basic it can probably just live in a .txt file to be manually copied over.

### XP PATH
    - Should not take a path as arg. I want to just run 'fxp', 'pxp', 'sxp', 'xxp' etc.
    - Call 'pxp' -> calls pathPxp -> pulls in Pesvint path and calls startPathing on that path.
    - NOTE: Should pathing code exist separate? Should that code live in a PathingService? YES!
        The Xp service will just pull in the path and delegate to pathing service.

### Triggers
    - The ONLY time to use Mudlet triggers are for triggers that need to be turned off somtimes, like the buff bot.
    - I always want to be able to exec xp bot or pk attacks etc, they are always on and available. Should exist in code.
    - What about my personal buff triggers? Why would I ever want those off? How can I set them? Trigger on "Vampa enters..."?
    - Could have an entire init class that triggers off of what I do when I login.
